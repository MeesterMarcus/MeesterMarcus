I was born and raised in San Antonio, TX, and as far back as I can remember, I've always had a strong passion for all things software. I would build computers, write software, build web applications and websites, and was always up to date with the latest technology news. I attended the University of Texas at San Antonio and earned my BS in Computer Science. I'm currently working at EControls as a Senior Full Stack Engineer. The one thing I love about this industry is that the learning never stops, and the challenges are always interesting. I hope my insight can help other professionals in the industry!
